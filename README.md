Emoji Selection

File Handling
Drag and drop files directly into the chatbox or click the paperclip icon to select files from your device. The selected files will be listed below the input field before being sent.

Refactoring and Code Structure
The project is organized into modular components, each handling a specific part of the chatbox's functionality:

HandleSendMessage: Manages message sending logic, including input validation and server communication.
HandleOptionSelect: Processes user option selections, updating the chat accordingly.
HandleKeyDown: Handles keyboard events, such as sending a message when the Enter key is pressed.
Emoji Selection: Integrated with emoji-mart for a user-friendly emoji picking experience.
This modular approach ensures that each function is reusable and the overall codebase is easier to maintain and extend.

Customization
You can easily customize the chatbox to fit your brand's identity by modifying the CSS files or adjusting the React components. The chat assistant's appearance, file handling behavior, and emoji selection can all be tailored to your specific needs.
